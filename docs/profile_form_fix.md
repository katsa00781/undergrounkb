# User Profile Form Fix

## Overview
This document covers the fix for the user profile form submission issue where profile updates weren't being properly saved to the database.

## Problem
The profile form was using `userProfile` and `updateUserProfile` from `useAuth()` directly, but these functions weren't properly implemented in the AuthContext. Additionally, the database schema needed columns for storing the profile form data.

## Solution

### 1. Created a new `useProfileProvider` hook
Created a dedicated hook for profile-related operations that properly bridges the gap between the authentication context and profile data. This hook:
- Safely handles all profile-related data
- Provides type safety for form fields
- Gracefully handles missing database columns

### 2. Updated the Profile component
Modified the Profile component to use the new `useProfileProvider` hook instead of directly using `useAuth`.

### 3. Added database schema migrations
Created migrations to add the necessary columns to the profiles table:
- height (numeric)
- weight (numeric)
- birthdate (date)
- gender (text)
- fitness_goals (text[])
- experience_level (text)

### 4. Added robust error handling
- Added validation to check which columns exist in the database
- Implemented fallbacks for missing columns
- Added user-friendly error messages

## Testing
Created scripts to:
1. Verify the profiles table structure
2. Apply necessary migrations
3. Test profile form submission

## Implementation Details

### useProfileProvider.ts
The core of our fix is a new hook that abstracts profile operations:
```typescript
export const useProfileProvider = () => {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  const { profile, setProfile } = useProfile();
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  
  // Safe conversion from database profile to form data
  const userProfile = ... 
  
  // Safe update function that handles missing columns
  const updateUserProfile = async (data) => ... 
  
  return { userProfile, updateUserProfile, isLoading };
};
```

### Profile.tsx
Updated to use our new hook:
```typescript
const Profile = () => {
  const { userProfile, updateUserProfile, isLoading } = useProfileProvider();
  // ...rest of component
};
```

## Conclusion
This fix addresses both the immediate form submission issue and provides a more robust architecture for profile management that's resilient to database schema changes.
